**Challenge 1**

1. (1) Use `filter(between())` to find characters whose heights are between 35.1 and 42.2 and (2) count the number of these observations. (Don't include 35.1 and 42.2)

```{r}
# Solution 
penguins %>% 
  filter(between(bill_length_mm, 35.1, 42.2))%>% # between is inclusive to endpoints 
  nrow()

```
**Challenge 2**

Use `str_detect()` to find all the penguins whose species includes "Chin"

```{r}

penguins %>%
  filter(str_detect(species, "Chin"))
  
```

**Challenge 3** 

Use `select(where())` to find only non-numeric columns 

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(-where(is.numeric))
```

**Challenge 4**

Use `select(match())` to find columns whose names include either "bill" or "mm". 

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(matches("bill|mm"))

```
