**Challenge 1**

1. (1) Use `filter(between())` to find characters whose heights are between 160 and 180 and (2) count the number of these observations. (Don't include 160 and 180)

```{r}
# Solution 
starwars %>% 
  filter(between(height, 161, 179))%>% # between is inclusive to endpoints 
  nrow()

```
**Challenge 2**

Use `str_detect()` to find characters whose names include "Han".

```{r}

starwars %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, "Han"))
  
```

**Challenge 3** 

Use `select(where())` to find only non-numeric columns 

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  select(-where(is.numeric))
```

**Challenge 4**

Use `select(matches())` to find columns whose names include either "sleep" or "wt". 

```{r}
msleep %>%
  select(matches("sleep|wt"))

```
